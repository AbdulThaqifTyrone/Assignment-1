Chelsea Merchandise Convenience
---------------------------------
This website are for chelsea fans all around the world. Some Chelsea Merchandise online stores are unavailable for somee parts of thee world. I intend to make a universal website that can be accessed by anyone around the world. The Main target audience is obviously Singapore as the prices on the website are in SGD. This is so I can encourage Singapore Chelsea Fans to support Chelsea by buying their merch through my website.


Design Process
-----------------------------------
My Website are for Chelsea fans around the world. However, it is mainly targeted to Singaporean Chelsea fans. This is because major flagship stores like Weston Corp are slowly dissappearing as their products are usually out of stock. This makes it a hassle for Singapore Chelsea Fans to buy Chelsea's Proucts as they have to buy it overseas and this increases the initial price that the fan is willing to pay as they have to also pay for shipping and money conversion fees.They also have to wait a longer period of time for their package to arrive as it is coming from the other side of the globe. With this website, i am the middle man for these fans as i ensure that they can get their merchandise at a slightly lower price and also arrving to their doorstrp faster.

I looked at Chelsea's Official website and couldnt help but notice how exorbitant their prices are. I emphatise with my fellow chelsea fans who want to buy Chelsea's merchandise.



Features
---------------------------------
Homepage - The Homepage contains a very brief overview on the website. It also attracts the user and ensure that the user will where are the things they are looking for.


History- The History page contains  bite-sized information so that chelsea fans know the Chelsea's roots. It is brief because the main part of the wesbsite is the shopping part.

Technologies used
------------------------------------------------

This includes the open and close menu for mobile users.





Testing
---------------------------------
